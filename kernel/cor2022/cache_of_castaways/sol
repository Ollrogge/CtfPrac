msg_msg disabled with: CONFIG_SYSVIPC

intended was struct cred

6 bytes overwrite of cred struct
  4 bytes `atomic_t usage`
  2 bytes `kuid_t uid`
    * works because uid generally under 65535

yea although depends how you spray
[2:44 AM]
pql sprayed with setuid which is actually smarter
[2:44 AM]
I sprayed with clone with some special flags
[2:44 AM]
to lower noise
[2:44 AM]
if you just fork randomly and try to do it
[2:44 AM]
chances of it working are extremely low i think
